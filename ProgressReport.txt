WEEK 1

-Completed installation of openFOAM
-Scripted ubuntu-'installer' and a build tool for the tutorial setup
-Progressed through tutorial 2.1 from http://www.openfoam.org/docs/user/cavity.php

-Simulations complete (channel):

--OneEqEddy

--Smagorinsky

--dynOneEqEddy

Got solution to dynS.
running atm: homogeniousDynSmagorinsky

Started working on cylinder, found case, will check more thurely. 
issue: Only half a cylinder?

Started working on assignments. Uncertain about style, waiting for feedback.

Familiarized with new concepts regarding the visualization of user spesific values (i.e. u-umean)


WEEK 2

-Rewrote cavity assignment
-Started writing on channel assignment

-All LES model simulations complete:
--OneEqEddy
--dynOneEqEddy
--Smagorinsky
--homogeneousDynSmagorinsky
--dynLagrangian

-All LES models produce "reasonable results" in comparison with eachother.
