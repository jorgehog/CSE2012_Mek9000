\section*{Generating the mesh}

In the example aviable from \textbf{usikker på hvordan du vil ordne dette} you will find a highly refined cylinder mesh. Running simulations on this mesh will take extremely long, but complex
geometries often demand high mesh resolutions to generate reasonable results. However, since we know the exact geometry, we can make controlled compromisses to the mesh. 

For the case of a cylinder, we will need the most resolution around the cylinder itself as well as in the region behind it where the turbulent flow will dominate. 
Using graded mesh refinement we can accomplish this by making the cells closer to the center smaller than the ones on the boundaries. The mesh blocks are placed in such a way that they make
up a \textit{scandinavian flag}. Run \verb+blockmesh+ on the provided case and visualize the mesh in paraFOAM using the \textit{wireframe} display option on a slice through the circular 
cylinder plane.
